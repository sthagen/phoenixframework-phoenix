## Phoenix Integration Tests

This project contains integration tests for phoenix's generated projects.

## Running tests

To install dependencies, run:

    $ mix deps.get

Then run the basic test suite (no dependencies on the database) with:

    $ mix test

To run the test suite with tests that test a specific database, run:

    $ mix test --include database:postgresql
    $ mix test --include database:mysql
    $ mix test --include database:mssql
    $ mix test --include database:sqlite3

For convenience, there is also a `docker-compose.yml` file that allows for starting up all of the supported databases locally.

    $ docker-compose up

This allows all tests to be run with the following command

    $ mix test --include database


## Alternative ways to run the integration tests

Phoenix uses Earthly as part of the CI process. It is possible to use earthly to test changes to integration tests locally.  It is also possible to run the CI process locally, which is helpful when debugging CI failures.  

[Installation Instructions](https://docs.earthly.dev/installation)

To run integration tests against all supported Elixir and OTP versions:

    $ earthly -P +all-integration-test
 

To test a specific version:

    $ earthly -P --build-arg ELIXIR=1.11.2 --build-arg OTP=21.3.8.18 +integration-test

To run the entire CI process locally, including unit and integration tests:

    $ earthly -P +all

## How tests are written

In order to have consistent, repeatable builds, all dependencies for all phoenix
project variations are listed in `mix.exs` and locked via `mix.lock`. If a
dependency version needs to be updated, it can be updated with `mix.exs` or
using `mix deps.update <dep name>`.

It is also important to note that dependencies are initially compiled with
`MIX_ENV=test` and then copied to `_build/dev_` to improve test speed.
Therefore, dependencies should not be listed in `mix.exs` with an `only: <env>`
option.
